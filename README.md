# CapstoneProject
For data in my capstone project
## Capstone project proposal
Use python programing to develop a daily fantasy football solver.
I will need to display data science skills in collection, cleaning, and transforming data in order to create value.
### Collection
I will need to scrape from the web 4 data sets. Play by play data, player prices(from daily fantasy site), injury reports, weather report
### Cleaning
I will need to format the data into useable data frames
### Transforming
I will need to use the past performance play by play data, weather reports, and injury reports to create projections for weekly points. I will need to then combine that data with a solving function to generate the most points possible based on the salary cap constraint.
