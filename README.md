# CapstoneProject
For data in my capstone project
## Capstone project proposal
Use python programing to develop a football betting solver.
I will need to display data science skills in collection, cleaning, and transforming data in order to create value.
### Collection
I will need to scrape from the web 1 data sets. Play by game results &weather reports
### Cleaning
I will need to format the data into useable data frames
### Transforming
I will use ML to predict a game result and confidence level. I will then use an algorithm to bet games that are over a certain confidence level and have favorable odds. I will us seasons 16-18 to train the algorithm, I will test on 19. Once I have tweaked the algorithm sucessfully I will go live on FY20 games.
